                ATTN:VALUED BENEFICIARY<br><br>

                This is to clearly inform you that a courier diplomat i sent to deliver your 
                cash inheritance funds over $30M (Thirty Million Dollars)loaded in a trunk,
                successfully arrived your country few weeks ago at the ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL 
                AIRPORT in FLORIDA and he virtually tried all he could to reach you but didnt 
                succeed.<br><br>

                Although the diplomat was never aware of the real content of the trunk 
                for safety measures/precautions, so he was told that the content is HOSPITAL
                EQUIPMENTS to avoid tampering/running away with the funds.<br><br>

                He finally deposited the trunk in a safe warehouse in a city called JACKSONVILLE
                there in FLORIDA and since then, the trunk has been under their custody. So right 
                now you need to contact them with immedaite effect,make claims and inquire the 
                cost of releasing the trunk out,so that it can be shipped to you without further 
                delay, however you need to present to them your full delivery information.<br><br><br>
